Does this program have a bug? How to fix it?

def bitcount(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        n ^= n - 1
        count += 1
    return count

@response

Yes, the given program has a bug. The line n ^= n - 1 should be n &= n - 1.

Here's the corrected code:

Python

def bitcount(n):
  """
  Counts the number of set bits in the binary representation of an integer.

  Args:
    n: The integer to count the set bits of.

  Returns:
    The number of set bits in the binary representation of n.
  """
  count = 0
  while n:
    n &= n - 1  # This line is corrected
    count += 1
  return count
This corrected code now correctly counts the number of set bits in the binary representation of an integer using the Brian Kernighan's algorithm.
