Does this program have a bug? How to fix it?

from heapq import *

def shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode):
    unvisited_nodes = [] # FibHeap containing (node, distance) pairs
    heappush(unvisited_nodes, (0, startnode))
    visited_nodes = set()

    while len(unvisited_nodes) > 0:
        distance, node = heappop(unvisited_nodes)
        if node is goalnode:
            return distance

        visited_nodes.add(node)

        for nextnode in node.successors:
            if nextnode in visited_nodes:
                continue

            insert_or_update(unvisited_nodes,
                (min(
                    get(unvisited_nodes, nextnode) or float('inf'),
                    get(unvisited_nodes, nextnode) + length_by_edge[node, nextnode]
                ),
                nextnode)
            )

    return float('inf')


def get(node_heap, wanted_node):
    for dist, node in node_heap:
        if node == wanted_node:
            return dist
    return 0

def insert_or_update(node_heap, dist_node):
    dist, node = dist_node
    for i, tpl in enumerate(node_heap):
        a, b = tpl
        if b == node:
            node_heap[i] = dist_node #heapq retains sorted property
            return None

    heappush(node_heap, dist_node)
    return None

Yes, the program has a few issues, and it doesn't correctly implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a heap. Let's walk through the problems and how to fix them.

üîç 1. Incorrect use of heapq / Priority Queue behavior
The biggest bug is here:

python
Copy
Edit
node_heap[i] = dist_node  # heapq retains sorted property
üî• This is wrong. Replacing an item in the middle of the heap does not maintain the heap property.

Fix: You must either:

Re-heapify the heap after modification: heapify(node_heap)

Or better: push the new item and ignore the old one (and filter out old nodes as they‚Äôre popped).

A typical pattern with heapq is to not update in place, but to push duplicates and track the best distances in a dict. When popping, skip stale nodes.

üîç 2. Faulty logic in get()
This function:

python
Copy
Edit
def get(node_heap, wanted_node):
    ...
    return 0
Returning 0 if the node isn't found can cause wrong distance calculations. It should return None.

üîç 3. Wrong distance update logic
In this line:

python
Copy
Edit
min(get(...) or inf, get(...) + length_by_edge[...])
You're using get() twice and assuming it returns the current distance‚Äîbut if it doesn‚Äôt exist, the logic breaks. Also, you're trying to minimize old distance and old distance + new edge length, which is incorrect.

It should be:

python
Copy
Edit
new_distance = distance + length_by_edge[node, nextnode]
‚úÖ Corrected Version
Here‚Äôs a corrected and simplified version:

python
Copy
Edit
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode):
    unvisited_nodes = []  # Min-heap of (distance, node)
    heappush(unvisited_nodes, (0, startnode))
    best_distance = {startnode: 0}
    visited_nodes = set()

    while unvisited_nodes:
        distance, node = heappop(unvisited_nodes)

        if node in visited_nodes:
            continue
        visited_nodes.add(node)

        if node is goalnode:
            return distance

        for nextnode in node.successors:
            if nextnode in visited_nodes:
                continue
            edge_length = length_by_edge.get((node, nextnode), float('inf'))
            new_distance = distance + edge_length

            if nextnode not in best_distance or new_distance < best_distance[nextnode]:
                best_distance[nextnode] = new_distance
                heappush(unvisited_nodes, (new_distance, nextnode))

    return float('inf')
Let me know if you want this adapted to support edge weights as objects or undirected graphs, or if node.successors needs clarification.

This is not correct. I received an error on the line 27 that says: "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Node' and 'Node'

Ah, got it ‚Äî that's a classic heapq issue when using tuples of (distance, node) and the distance values are equal. Python tries to compare the second elements (the Node objects), but custom classes like Node don‚Äôt have a defined ordering, so it throws:

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Node' and 'Node'

üí° Why This Happens:
heapq compares the tuples (distance, node). If two nodes have equal distances, it tries to compare the Node objects directly to break the tie ‚Äî which fails if Node doesn‚Äôt implement __lt__().

‚úÖ Two Fix Options:
‚úÖ Option 1: Add a tiebreaker (recommended)
Use a counter to break ties so Python never compares Node instances directly.

python
Copy
Edit
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from itertools import count

def shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode):
    counter = count()  # tie-breaker
    unvisited_nodes = []  # Heap of (distance, count, node)
    heappush(unvisited_nodes, (0, next(counter), startnode))
    best_distance = {startnode: 0}
    visited_nodes = set()

    while unvisited_nodes:
        distance, _, node = heappop(unvisited_nodes)

        if node in visited_nodes:
            continue
        visited_nodes.add(node)

        if node is goalnode:
            return distance

        for nextnode in node.successors:
            if nextnode in visited_nodes:
                continue

            edge_length = length_by_edge.get((node, nextnode), float('inf'))
            new_distance = distance + edge_length

            if nextnode not in best_distance or new_distance < best_distance[nextnode]:
                best_distance[nextnode] = new_distance
                heappush(unvisited_nodes, (new_distance, next(counter), nextnode))

    return float('inf')
‚úÖ Option 2: Implement comparison in Node
If you control the Node class, you can define __lt__ like this:

python
Copy
Edit
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.successors = []

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.name < other.name
This will let Python break ties using name, but it‚Äôs less robust and might lead to hidden bugs if node names aren't unique.

üß™ Want to Test It?
If you can share the structure of your Node class or a sample graph input, I can give you a complete working example too.
