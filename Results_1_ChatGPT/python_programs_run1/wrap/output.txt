Yes, this program has a bug. The issue is that after splitting text, the remaining text (text[end:]) may still start with a space, which is carried over to the next iteration. This can cause extra leading spaces in subsequent lines.

Fix: Strip Leading Spaces
To fix this, strip any leading spaces from text after cutting the line:

python
Copy
Edit
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()  # Strip leading spaces
        lines.append(line)

    lines.append(text)  # Append remaining text
    return lines
Explanation of Fix
lstrip() ensures that any leading spaces in the remaining text are removed.

lines.append(text) ensures that the last part of the text is added, even if it's shorter than cols.

Would you like any modifications, such as handling hyphenated words better?
