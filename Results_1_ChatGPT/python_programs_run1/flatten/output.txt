Yes, this program has a bug. The issue is in the else case:

python
Copy
Edit
else:
    yield flatten(x)
Issue:
When x is not a list, the function calls flatten(x), which returns a generator instead of yielding the value directly.
This causes an unwanted nested generator structure, which is incorrect.
Fix:
Modify the else case to yield x directly:

python
Copy
Edit
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x  # Fix: Yield the value directly
Example Test Cases:
python
Copy
Edit
print(list(flatten([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6])))
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
This corrected version correctly flattens a nested list into a single sequence.
