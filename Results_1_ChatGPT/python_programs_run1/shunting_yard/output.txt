Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is that operators are never pushed onto the opstack, which means that the final output will always be incorrect.

Issue
When an operator token (e.g., +, -, *, /) is encountered, the code only pops from the stack based on precedence but never pushes the current operator onto the stack.

Fix
You need to push the current operator onto opstack after popping operators with higher or equal precedence.

Corrected Code
python
Copy
Edit
def shunting_yard(tokens):
    precedence = {
        '+': 1,
        '-': 1,
        '*': 2,
        '/': 2
    }

    rpntokens = []
    opstack = []

    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, int):
            rpntokens.append(token)
        else:
            while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:
                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())
            opstack.append(token)  # Push the current operator onto the stack

    while opstack:
        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())

    return rpntokens
Example Usage
python
Copy
Edit
tokens = [3, '+', 5, '*', 2]
print(shunting_yard(tokens))
Expected Output (Postfix Notation)
css
Copy
Edit
[3, 5, 2, '*', '+']
This correctly converts the infix expression 3 + 5 * 2 to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) as 3 5 2 * +.
