Your rpn_eval function is almost correct for evaluating Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expressions. However, there are a couple of potential issues to address:

Order of operands in the operation: In an RPN expression, the operands for an operator should be popped in the correct order. You first pop a and then b but apply the operator to b and a. This is wrong because the first popped operand (a) should be the second operand, and the second popped operand (b) should be the first operand.

Handling of invalid tokens: It's a good idea to add error handling for cases when an invalid operator or number is encountered.

Here's the corrected version of your function:

python
Copy
Edit
def rpn_eval(tokens):
    def op(symbol, a, b):
        if symbol == '/' and b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Division by zero")  # Raise a more informative error
        return {
            '+': lambda a, b: a + b,
            '-': lambda a, b: a - b,
            '*': lambda a, b: a * b,
            '/': lambda a, b: a / b
        }[symbol](a, b)

    stack = []

    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, (float, int)):  # Allow both floats and integers as valid numbers
            stack.append(token)
        else:  # Assuming the token is an operator
            if len(stack) < 2:
                raise ValueError("Insufficient operands for operation.")
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop b first, then a
            a = stack.pop()  # Pop a second
            stack.append(op(token, a, b))

    if len(stack) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Invalid expression, too many operands.")

    return stack.pop()
Key Improvements:
Correct Operand Order: b is popped before a, so the operator is applied to a and b in the correct order.
Operand and Operator Checks: It ensures that there are enough operands in the stack before performing an operation. If there are not enough operands, it raises an error.
General Validity Check: It ensures that there is exactly one value left in the stack at the end, which is the result of the evaluation.
