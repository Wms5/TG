Yes, there is a bug in this program. The issue is in the line:

python
Copy
Edit
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]
)
Problem
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm should use the sum of the paths length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j], but the program mistakenly uses length_by_path[j, k] instead of length_by_path[k, j].

Fix
Change:

python
Copy
Edit
length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]
to:

python
Copy
Edit
length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
Corrected Code
python
Copy
Edit
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]  # Fixed here
                )

    return length_by_path
Now, the function correctly computes the shortest path lengths using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. ðŸš€
