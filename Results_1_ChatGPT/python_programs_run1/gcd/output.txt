Yes, this program has a bug. The issue is with the recursive call:

python
Copy
Edit
return gcd(a % b, b)
The arguments should be swapped to ensure proper calculation of the greatest common divisor. The correct version should be:

python
Copy
Edit
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
Explanation of the Fix:
The Euclidean algorithm for computing GCD works by recursively calling gcd(b, a % b), not gcd(a % b, b).
The original code incorrectly passes a % b as the first argument instead of the second argument, which causes incorrect results.
Example of Correct Behavior:
python
Copy
Edit
print(gcd(48, 18))  # Correct output: 6
