Your program for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is almost correct, but there's a small issue in how you're forming the steps. Specifically, the line where you're appending the move steps.append((start, helper)) needs to be fixed. You're correctly choosing the helper peg, but the actual move is between the start and helper pegs, which is done at the wrong step.

Also, steps.append((start, helper)) represents the move between start and helper, but it should be placed between the recursive calls after the first set of moves and before the second set.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

python
Copy
Edit
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        # Choose the helper peg, which is the only one not start or end
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()

        # Move the n-1 disks from start to helper
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))

        # Move the remaining disk from start to end
        steps.append((start, end))

        # Move the n-1 disks from helper to end
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
Explanation of changes:
The move (start, helper) is corrected to (start, end) in the line steps.append((start, end)), which properly represents moving the top disk from start to end.
The recursive calls around this are correct â€” first moving height - 1 disks from start to helper, then moving the largest disk from start to end, and then moving the height - 1 disks from helper to end.
This should now solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and return the correct list of steps.
