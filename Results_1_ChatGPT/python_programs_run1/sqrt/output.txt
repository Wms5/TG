Yes, this program has a bug. The issue is in the while condition:

python
Copy
Edit
while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:
Issue
The condition should check the difference between approx ** 2 and x, not x - approx.

The program is intended to compute the square root of x using Newton's method, but the stopping condition should compare approx^2 to x to ensure the approximation is close enough.

Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x / 2
    while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon:
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)
    return approx
Explanation of Fix
The stopping condition now correctly checks abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon, ensuring that the square of the approximation is sufficiently close to x.

This correctly implements Newton's method for computing square roots.

Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸš€
