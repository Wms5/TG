Yes, there is a bug in the program. The issue is in the second loop:

python
Copy
Edit
for i, count in enumerate(arr):
Problems:
Incorrect Loop Variable:
enumerate(arr) iterates over arr, but it should iterate over counts instead.
i should represent the index (i.e., the value from the original array), and count should represent how many times it appears.
Fix:
Change enumerate(arr) to enumerate(counts), so that i refers to the index in counts and count gives how many times i should be repeated.
Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def bucketsort(arr, k):
    counts = [0] * k  # Initialize count array

    # Count occurrences of each number
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1

    sorted_arr = []

    # Construct sorted array
    for i, count in enumerate(counts):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * count)

    return sorted_arr
Example Run:
python
Copy
Edit
arr = [3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 3]
k = 4  # Assuming values are in range 0 to k-1
print(bucketsort(arr, k))
Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Now the function correctly sorts the array! ðŸš€
