Yes, there is a bug in your mergesort function. The issue is in this line inside the merge function:

python
Copy
Edit
result.extend(left[i:] or right[j:])
Bug Explanation:
The or operator here causes unintended behavior. If left[i:] is empty, right[j:] will be appended. However, if left[i:] is not empty, right[j:] will be ignored completely. This is incorrect because we need to append both the remaining elements from left and right, not just one of them.

How to Fix:
Replace the incorrect line with two separate extend calls:

python
Copy
Edit
result.extend(left[i:])
result.extend(right[j:])
Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def mergesort(arr):
    def merge(left, right):
        result = []
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] <= right[j]:
                result.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                result.append(right[j])
                j += 1
        result.extend(left[i:])  # Append remaining elements from left
        result.extend(right[j:])  # Append remaining elements from right
        return result

    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr  # Base case: Return the array itself if it has 0 or 1 elements

    middle = len(arr) // 2
    left = mergesort(arr[:middle])
    right = mergesort(arr[middle:])
    return merge(left, right)
Why This Works:
Now, all remaining elements from both left and right get properly added to result.
The base case is adjusted to return arr if its length is <= 1, ensuring correctness.
This should now work correctly as a stable Merge Sort implementation! âœ…
