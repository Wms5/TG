Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is in the else clause:

python
Copy
Edit
yield flatten(x)
Instead of yielding x directly when it's not a list, it mistakenly calls flatten(x), which returns a generator rather than the value itself. This leads to incorrect behavior.

Fix:
You should simply yield x when x is not a list:

python
Copy
Edit
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x  # Fix: Yield x directly
Example Usage:
python
Copy
Edit
nested_list = [1, [2, [3, 4]], 5]
print(list(flatten(nested_list)))
Output:
csharp
Copy
Edit
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Now, the function correctly flattens a nested list into a single sequence of values.
