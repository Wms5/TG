Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is in this line:

python
Copy
Edit
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]
)
Bug Explanation
In the Floyd-Warshall algorithm (which this code is implementing), the correct update formula should be:

python
Copy
Edit
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
)
Notice the correction: length_by_path[k, j] instead of length_by_path[j, k].

Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]  # Corrected here
                )

    return length_by_path
Explanation of Fix
The original incorrect formula tries to construct the shortest path from i to j using the wrong intermediate nodes (j, k instead of k, j).
The corrected version properly updates length_by_path[i, j] using an intermediate node k by considering paths i â†’ k and k â†’ j.
Now, the function correctly computes the shortest path lengths for all pairs using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. ðŸš€
