Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is that when processing operators, the program does not push the current operator onto the stack after popping higher or equal precedence operators.

Bug Explanation:
After popping operators with higher or equal precedence, the current operator should be pushed onto the stack, but this step is missing.

As a result, the operator stack remains empty, and operators are not correctly stored.

Fix:
Add a line to push token onto opstack after popping higher or equal precedence operators.

Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def shunting_yard(tokens):
    precedence = {
        '+': 1,
        '-': 1,
        '*': 2,
        '/': 2
    }

    rpntokens = []
    opstack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, int):  # Operand, add directly to output
            rpntokens.append(token)
        else:  # Operator
            while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:
                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())
            opstack.append(token)  # Push current operator onto stack

    while opstack:  # Pop remaining operators
        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())

    return rpntokens
Example Run:
python
Copy
Edit
tokens = [3, '+', 4, '*', 2]
print(shunting_yard(tokens))
Expected Output (RPN Notation):
css
Copy
Edit
[3, 4, 2, '*', '+']
This follows the correct Shunting-Yard Algorithm and converts infix expressions to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) correctly.
