Yes, the program has a bug. The logic in the recursive call is incorrect. The function gcd(a % b, b) should be gcd(b, a % b).

Hereâ€™s why:

The Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) works by repeatedly applying the formula gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b). The values a and b are swapped in the recursive call, with the second argument being a % b.

So the correct function should be:

python
Copy
Edit
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
This should work as expected now.
