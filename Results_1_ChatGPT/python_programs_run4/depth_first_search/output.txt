Yes, there is a bug in this program. The issue is that the function does not mark node as visited before recursively exploring its successors. This can lead to infinite recursion in cyclic graphs.

Bug Explanation
The nodesvisited set is used to track visited nodes, but nodes are not added to it before recursive calls.
If there is a cycle in the graph, the function may revisit the same nodes indefinitely, leading to infinite recursion.
Fix
Modify the search_from function to add node to nodesvisited before making recursive calls:

python
Copy
Edit
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        nodesvisited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited before recursion

        if node is goalnode:
            return True

        return any(search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors)

    return search_from(startnode)
Why This Fix Works
It ensures that each node is added to nodesvisited before its successors are explored.
Prevents infinite loops in graphs with cycles.
Correctly terminates when goalnode is found.
