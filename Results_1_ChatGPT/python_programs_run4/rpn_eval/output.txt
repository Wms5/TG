Yes, the code does have a potential bug. The issue lies in how the operands are popped from the stack. In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), the operands should be applied in the correct order: the first operand is pushed onto the stack first, and then the second operand is pushed after it. However, when you are popping the operands for the operation (a = stack.pop() and b = stack.pop()), this order is reversed.

The correct order for RPN is that the second operand should be popped first, and the first operand should be popped second.

Here is how to fix it:

python
Copy
Edit
def rpn_eval(tokens):
    def op(symbol, a, b):
        return {
            '+': lambda a, b: a + b,
            '-': lambda a, b: a - b,
            '*': lambda a, b: a * b,
            '/': lambda a, b: a / b
        }[symbol](a, b)

    stack = []

    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, (int, float)):  # allow both int and float values
            stack.append(token)
        else:
            b = stack.pop()  # Pop second operand first
            a = stack.pop()  # Pop first operand second
            stack.append(
                op(token, a, b)
            )

    return stack.pop()
Explanation of changes:
I modified the operand order for the pop() operations to ensure the operands are used in the correct order (the second operand is b, and the first operand is a).
I also updated the isinstance check to accept both int and float as valid operand types (just to handle integer inputs as well).
With these changes, the function should now evaluate the RPN expression correctly.
