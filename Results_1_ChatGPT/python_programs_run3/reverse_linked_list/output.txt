Yes, there's a bug in your code.

The issue lies in the fact that you're using node.successor to access the next node. The term successor is often used to represent the next node in a linked list, but in Python, you should confirm that the linked list node has a successor attribute. Typically, the next node is accessed using the next attribute.

Here’s how to fix it:

python
Copy
Edit
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.next  # Use 'next' instead of 'successor'
        node.next = prevnode
        prevnode = node  # Move prevnode to the current node
        node = nextnode  # Move to the next node
    return prevnode
Explanation of the fix:
node.successor → node.next: Changed to use the common next attribute instead of successor. If your node class uses successor, you can keep it, but ensure it's defined correctly.
prevnode = node: Update prevnode to the current node after the pointer reversal.
Move to the next node: After setting node.next to prevnode, you then update node to nextnode to continue traversing the list.
This should properly reverse the linked list.
