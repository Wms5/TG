Yes, there is a bug in this program. The issue is in the recursive calls to binsearch():

Bug Explanation
Infinite Recursion:
When x > arr[mid], the function calls binsearch(mid, end), but mid is included again in the next search range. This can lead to infinite recursion if mid does not change (e.g., in cases where start == mid).
The same issue does not occur in x < arr[mid], since mid is correctly excluded (binsearch(start, mid)).
Base Case Issue:
The base case if start == end: return -1 is incorrect because binary search typically stops when start > end, not just when they are equal.
Fix
Change binsearch(mid, end) to binsearch(mid + 1, end) to avoid infinite recursion.
Modify the base case condition to if start >= end to correctly terminate when the element is not found.
Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start >= end:  # Base case should check start >= end
            return -1
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid)
        elif x > arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(mid + 1, end)  # Ensure progress in the search
        else:
            return mid

    return binsearch(0, len(arr))
Now, the function correctly implements a binary search and avoids infinite recursion.
