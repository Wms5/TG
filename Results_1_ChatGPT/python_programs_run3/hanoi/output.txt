The code you provided for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem is mostly correct, but it has a small mistake in the step where the move from start to helper is added to steps.

The steps.append((start, helper)) line should represent the actual move from start to end (not start to helper), because helper is just a temporary holding peg. The recursive structure seems correct, but this single line is what needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

python
Copy
Edit
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))  # Correct this line to move from start to end
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
Explanation of the fix:
The line steps.append((start, helper)) is changed to steps.append((start, end)), which correctly reflects the move from the start peg to the end peg.
This should now work as expected and return the sequence of steps needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for a given height.
