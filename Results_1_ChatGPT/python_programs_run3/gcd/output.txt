Yes, there is a bug in the gcd function. The issue is in the recursive call within the else clause. The correct Euclidean algorithm should recursively call gcd(b, a % b) rather than gcd(a % b, b).

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the program:

python
Copy
Edit
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
In the original code, the order of the arguments in the recursive call was incorrect. The Euclidean algorithm works by reducing the problem to finding the greatest common divisor of b and the remainder when a is divided by b (i.e., a % b).
