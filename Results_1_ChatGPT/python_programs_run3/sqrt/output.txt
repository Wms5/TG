Yes, the program does have a bug. The issue lies in the condition for the while loop, where it compares abs(x - approx) instead of comparing abs(approx * approx - x). Here's why:

In the current version, the loop continues running as long as the difference between x and approx is greater than epsilon. However, approx is being updated in a way that brings it closer to the square root of x, so the comparison should check how close approx * approx is to x.

Fix:
Update the while loop condition to check abs(approx * approx - x) instead of abs(x - approx).

Corrected code:
python
Copy
Edit
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x / 2
    while abs(approx * approx - x) > epsilon:
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)
    return approx
Explanation:
approx * approx will give the current estimate of the square of approx, which is what we are trying to get as close as possible to x.

The loop continues until approx * approx is within an acceptable range of x (i.e., epsilon).

This should fix the issue and return the correct square root approximation.
