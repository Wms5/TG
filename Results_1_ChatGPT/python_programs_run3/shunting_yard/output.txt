Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is that operators are never pushed onto opstack. The function is missing the step where it actually pushes the current operator onto the stack after popping higher or equal precedence operators.

Bug Analysis
When encountering an operator (+, -, *, /), the program correctly pops operators of higher or equal precedence from opstack to rpntokens.

However, after that, it fails to push the current operator onto opstack.

As a result, opstack remains empty, and all operators are lost, leading to incorrect output.

Fixed Code

Edit
def shunting_yard(tokens):
    precedence = {
        '+': 1,
        '-': 1,
        '*': 2,
        '/': 2
    }

    rpntokens = []
    opstack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, int):  # If it's a number, add to output
            rpntokens.append(token)
        else:  # If it's an operator
            while opstack and precedence[opstack[-1]] >= precedence[token]:
                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())
            opstack.append(token)  # Push current operator onto stack

    while opstack:  # Pop remaining operators
        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())

    return rpntokens
Example Test Case
python

Edit
tokens = [3, '+', 5, '*', 2]
print(shunting_yard(tokens))
Expected Output (Reverse Polish Notation)

Edit
[3, 5, 2, '*', '+']
Now the function correctly converts infix expressions to postfix notation using the Shunting-Yard algorithm. ðŸš€
