Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is in how the result string is constructed. Since the new digits are appended to the end of result, the final string will be in reverse order.

Bug Explanation:
The correct way to convert a number to another base is by prepending digits (or reversing the final result). The current implementation appends digits instead, leading to an incorrect order.

Fix:
Modify the code to prepend digits by using string concatenation with result = alphabet[i] + result. This ensures the digits are in the correct order.

Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
import string

def to_base(num, b):
    if num == 0:
        return "0"  # Handle the case where num is 0
    result = ''
    alphabet = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase
    while num > 0:
        i = num % b
        num = num // b
        result = alphabet[i] + result  # Fix: Prepend instead of append
    return result
Example Runs:
python
Copy
Edit
print(to_base(255, 16))  # Expected: "FF"
print(to_base(10, 2))    # Expected: "1010"
print(to_base(0, 8))     # Expected: "0"
Now, the function correctly converts numbers to their respective bases. ðŸš€
