Yes, there is a potential bug in your code that could result in an AttributeError. Specifically, if hare.successor is None at any point, the code attempts to access hare.successor.successor, which will throw an error because you're trying to access an attribute of None.

Here's how you can fix it:

Corrected Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare is None or hare.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
Explanation:
Line 5: We check if hare or hare.successor is None before trying to move hare two steps ahead. This prevents the AttributeError.
The rest of the code works as intended for detecting cycles using the "tortoise and hare" (Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm).
This should now correctly detect cycles in a linked list, assuming node represents the head of the list and successor is the pointer to the next node.
