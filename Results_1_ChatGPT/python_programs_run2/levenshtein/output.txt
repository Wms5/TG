Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is in the recursive case when the first characters of source and target match. Instead of adding 1, it should add 0 because no edit is needed.

Bug Analysis
Incorrect Line:
python
Copy
Edit
elif source[0] == target[0]:
    return 1 + levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])
The 1 + is incorrect here because when the first characters match, no edit operation is needed.
It should simply return the recursive result without adding 1.
Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '' or target == '':
        return len(source) or len(target)

    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])  # Fixed line: No extra cost for matching characters

    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),  # Insertion
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),  # Substitution
            levenshtein(source[1:], target)       # Deletion
        )
Further Optimization Considerations
This recursive approach has exponential time complexity (O(3^n)), making it inefficient for long strings.
You can improve it with memoization (top-down DP) or dynamic programming (bottom-up DP) to achieve O(m * n) complexity.
Would you like an optimized version with memoization? ðŸš€
