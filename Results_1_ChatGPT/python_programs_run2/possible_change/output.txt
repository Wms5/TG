Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is that possible_change(coins, total - first) calls possible_change with the same coins list, meaning it will repeatedly use the first coin indefinitely. This results in incorrect behavior when counting possible ways to make change.

Bug Explanation
When using first, the function should allow reusing it (i.e., keep coins unchanged).
When excluding first, the function should move on to rest.
Corrected Code
Fix this by modifying the recursive calls:

python
Copy
Edit
def possible_change(coins, total):
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0 or not coins:
        return 0

    first, *rest = coins
    return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total)
Fixes Applied
Stopping Condition for Empty Coins: Added or not coins in if total < 0 or not coins: to prevent an empty list from causing unpacking errors.
Proper Inclusion/Exclusion of Coins:
possible_change(coins, total - first): Includes first, so the same list is used (allowing reuse of that coin).
possible_change(rest, total): Excludes first, so it moves to rest.
Now, the function correctly computes the number of ways to make change.
