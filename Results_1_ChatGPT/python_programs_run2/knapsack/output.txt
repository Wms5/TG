Yes, there is a bug in the program. The issue is in the condition:

python
Copy
Edit
if weight < j:
Bug Explanation
The condition should be if weight <= j: instead of if weight < j:.
The current condition incorrectly excludes cases where the item's weight exactly equals the remaining capacity.
As a result, some optimal solutions are not considered.
Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
def knapsack(capacity, items):
    from collections import defaultdict
    memo = defaultdict(int)

    for i in range(1, len(items) + 1):
        weight, value = items[i - 1]

        for j in range(1, capacity + 1):
            memo[i, j] = memo[i - 1, j]  # Not taking the item

            if weight <= j:  # Fix: Allow weight == j
                memo[i, j] = max(
                    memo[i, j],
                    value + memo[i - 1, j - weight]  # Taking the item
                )

    return memo[len(items), capacity]
Alternative Optimization
If you're looking for a more optimized bottom-up dynamic programming approach, consider using a 2D array instead of defaultdict, or even better, a 1D array to reduce space complexity to O(capacity).
