Yes, the program has a bug in the while condition. The issue is with the condition:

python
Copy
Edit
while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:
Bug Explanation
The condition should check the difference between approx ** 2 (which is the square of the approximation) and x, rather than x - approx.

Right now, it compares the difference between x and approx, which does not properly check how close approx ** 2 is to x.

Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x / 2  # Initial guess
    while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon:  # Fix condition
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)  # Newton's method update
    return approx
Example Usage
python
Copy
Edit
print(sqrt(25, 0.0001))  # Output: approximately 5.0
print(sqrt(2, 0.0001))   # Output: approximately 1.414
Key Fix
Changed abs(x - approx) to abs(approx**2 - x), ensuring the loop stops when approx**2 is sufficiently close to x.
This correctly applies Newtonâ€™s Method to approximate the square root.
