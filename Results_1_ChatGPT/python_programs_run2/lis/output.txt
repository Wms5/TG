Yes, this program has a bug. The issue arises when accessing arr[ends[length + 1]] in this condition:

python
Copy
Edit
if length == longest or val < arr[ends[length + 1]]:
Problems
KeyError in ends[length + 1]

The dictionary ends maps the length of subsequences to indices in arr.
The key length + 1 may not exist in ends, leading to a KeyError when accessing arr[ends[length + 1]].
Comparison Issue (arr[ends[length + 1]])

Before checking val < arr[ends[length + 1]], you need to ensure that ends[length + 1] exists.
Fix
Modify the condition to check whether length + 1 exists in ends before accessing it:

python
Copy
Edit
def lis(arr):
    ends = {}
    longest = 0

    for i, val in enumerate(arr):

        prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]

        length = max(prefix_lengths) if prefix_lengths else 0

        # Ensure ends[length + 1] exists before accessing it
        if length == longest or (length + 1 not in ends or val < arr[ends[length + 1]]):
            ends[length + 1] = i
            longest = length + 1

    return longest
Alternative Approach (Using Binary Search)
A more efficient way to compute the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) Length is by using binary search with bisect:

python
Copy
Edit
from bisect import bisect_left

def lis(arr):
    sub = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect_left(sub, val)  # Find position in subsequence
        if pos == len(sub):
            sub.append(val)  # Extend the sequence
        else:
            sub[pos] = val  # Replace the element
    return len(sub)
Complexity
The fixed version of your approach runs in O(nÂ²).
The binary search version runs in O(n log n).
