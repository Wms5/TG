Yes, this program has a bug. The issue is that when the text is split, the remaining text still contains a leading space (if the split occurred at a space). This can lead to incorrect formatting.

Bug:
The line line, text = text[:end], text[end:] does not strip leading spaces from text, which may result in unnecessary spaces at the beginning of new lines.

Fix:
Strip leading spaces from the remaining text after splitting.

Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()  # Remove leading spaces from remaining text
        lines.append(line)

    lines.append(text)  # Add the last part of the text
    return lines
Explanation of Fix:
text[end:].lstrip(): Removes any leading spaces in the remaining text after splitting.

lines.append(text) at the end: Ensures the last remaining text is included in the output.

This will now correctly wrap text without introducing leading spaces in subsequent lines. ðŸš€
