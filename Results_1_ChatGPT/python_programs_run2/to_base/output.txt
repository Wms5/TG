Yes, this program has a bug: the result string is being constructed by appending new characters to the end, which results in the digits of the converted number being in reverse order.

Fix: Reverse the Order of Digits
To fix this, you can prepend the digits (or use .join(reversed(result))) to ensure the result is in the correct order. Alternatively, you can build the string correctly using a list and reverse it at the end.

Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
import string

def to_base(num, b):
    if num == 0:
        return "0"  # Handle the special case where num is 0

    result = []
    alphabet = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase
    while num > 0:
        i = num % b
        num = num // b
        result.append(alphabet[i])  # Append digits

    return ''.join(result[::-1])  # Reverse before returning

# Test cases
print(to_base(255, 16))  # Expected: "FF"
print(to_base(10, 2))    # Expected: "1010"
print(to_base(100, 8))   # Expected: "144"
Other Fixes and Improvements
Handle num == 0 case explicitly: Without this, an input of 0 would return an empty string.

Use a list instead of string concatenation: String concatenation (result = result + alphabet[i]) is inefficient in Python due to immutability.

Reverse the result at the end: This ensures correct ordering of digits.
