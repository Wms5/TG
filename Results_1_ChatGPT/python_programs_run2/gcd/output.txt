Yes, this program has a bug that can cause infinite recursion in some cases.

Bug Explanation:
In the recursive call:

python
Copy
Edit
return gcd(a % b, b)
The order of arguments is incorrect. The second argument should be a % b, and the first argument should be b, ensuring that the recursion correctly reduces the values.

Corrected Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
Why This Fix Works?
The Euclidean algorithm for computing GCD correctly reduces (a, b) to (b, a % b).
The base case correctly stops recursion when b == 0, returning a as the GCD.
Example Runs:
python
Copy
Edit
print(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6
print(gcd(101, 103))  # Output: 1
Now, the function correctly computes the GCD for all input cases. ðŸš€
