Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is in the update step inside the triple-nested loop:

python
Copy
Edit
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]
)
Bug Explanation
The line length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k] is incorrect because it tries to use length_by_path[j, k] instead of length_by_path[k, j]. In Floyd-Warshall's algorithm, the correct update formula should be:

\text{length_by_path}[i, j] = \min(\text{length_by_path}[i, j], \text{length_by_path}[i, k] + \text{length_by_path}[k, j])
Using length_by_path[j, k] incorrectly calculates distances, leading to incorrect shortest path values.

Fixed Code
python
Copy
Edit
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]  # Fix here
                )

    return length_by_path
Summary of Fix
Changed length_by_path[j, k] to length_by_path[k, j] in the update formula.
Now the function correctly implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing shortest path lengths. ðŸš€
