Yes, the program has a bug. The issue is that it does not mark nodes as visited when exploring them, which can lead to infinite recursion in cyclic graphs. Additionally, goalnode should be checked using == instead of is to ensure proper equality checking.

Bug Fixes:
Mark nodes as visited: Add node to nodesvisited at the beginning of search_from(node).
Use == instead of is: The goalnode comparison should use == to check for equality rather than is, which checks object identity.
Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        nodesvisited.add(node)  # Mark node as visited

        if node == goalnode:  # Use == for comparison
            return True

        return any(search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors)

    return search_from(startnode)
Explanation of Fixes:
Avoids infinite loops by keeping track of visited nodes.
Ensures correct goal checking using == instead of is, since nodes may not be the same object but can still be equal in value.
This should now work correctly for acyclic and cyclic graphs. ðŸš€
