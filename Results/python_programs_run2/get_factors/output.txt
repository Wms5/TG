Identifying the Bug:

The primary issue with the provided get_factors function lies in its recursive approach and the way it handles prime numbers. It fails to include the prime number itself as a factor in certain cases.

Fixing the Bug:

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the prime number issue and optimizes the factor calculation:

Python

def get_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1

    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors
Explanation of the Correction:

Iterative Approach: The corrected function uses an iterative approach, which is often more efficient than recursion for this kind of problem.
Prime Factorization: It iteratively divides n by its smallest prime factors, adding them to the factors list.
Handling Prime Numbers: If the loop finishes and n is still greater than 1, it means n itself is a prime number, so it's added to the factors list.
Example Usage:

Python

print(get_factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(get_factors(17))  # Output: [17]
print(get_factors(1))   # Output: []
This corrected function provides a more accurate and efficient solution for finding the factors of a given number.
