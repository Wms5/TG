Identifying the Bug

The primary issue with the provided flatten function lies in the recursive call within the else block. When x is not a list, recursively calling flatten(x) on a non-list element will lead to an infinite recursion, causing a RecursionError.

Fixing the Bug

To correct this, we need to directly yield x when x is not a list:

Python
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            yield from flatten(x)
        else:
            yield x

Explanation of the Fix

Iterating over arr: The outer loop iterates over each element x in the input list arr.
Checking for Lists: If x is a list, we recursively call flatten on it. The yield from syntax efficiently flattens the nested list and yields its elements one by one.
Yielding Non-List Elements: If x is not a list, we directly yield x, adding it to the flattened output.
This revised flatten function correctly handles both list and non-list elements, ensuring a proper flattening process without unnecessary recursion.
