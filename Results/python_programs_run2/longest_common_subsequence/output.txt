Identifying the Bug

The provided Python code implements a recursive approach to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings a and b. However, there's a subtle inefficiency in the else branch.

The problem lies in the recursive calls. In the else branch, both recursive calls, longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]) and longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b), potentially recalculate the same subproblems multiple times. This leads to exponential time complexity.

Fixing the Bug: Dynamic Programming

To optimize this, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. This involves creating a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] stores the length of the LCS for the substrings a[i:] and b[j:].

Here's the corrected code using dynamic programming:

Python

def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    m, n = len(a), len(b)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Construct the LCS from the dp table
    lcs = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(a[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    return ''.join(reversed(lcs))
Explanation of the Dynamic Programming Approach:

Initialization: Create a 2D table dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) and initialize it with zeros.
Filling the Table: Iterate over the table, filling each cell dp[i][j] based on the following:
If a[i-1] and b[j-1] are equal, the LCS length is one more than the LCS length of the preceding substrings.
Otherwise, the LCS length is the maximum of the LCS lengths of the substrings obtained by removing the last character from either a or b.
Constructing the LCS: Trace back through the table to reconstruct the actual LCS.
By using dynamic programming, we avoid redundant calculations and achieve a time complexity of O(mn). This is a significant improvement over the exponential time complexity of the original recursive approach.
