Identifying the Bug:

The primary issue with the provided code lies in the calculation of the dp values. The problem arises when accessing dp[i - 1, j] for the base case, where i is 0. In this scenario, the index i - 1 would be negative, leading to an invalid access.

Fixing the Bug:

To rectify this, we need to handle the base cases explicitly. Here's the corrected code:

Python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import defaultdict

    dp = defaultdict(int)  # Using defaultdict for efficient handling of missing keys

    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                # Handle base cases explicitly
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i, j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1

    return max(dp.values())

Explanation of the Fix:

Using defaultdict: This ensures that accessing dp[i, j] for uninitialized keys returns 0, simplifying the base case handling.
Handling Base Cases:
If either i or j is 0, it means we've reached the beginning of one of the strings. In this case, if the current characters match, we can directly set dp[i, j] to 1, indicating a length of 1 for the LCS.
Otherwise, we use the standard recurrence relation dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1 to calculate the LCS length.
By addressing the base case issue and using the defaultdict for efficient handling of missing keys, the corrected code accurately computes the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) length between the two input strings.
