The provided Python code for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm is correct and bug-free.

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

Base case: If b is 0, the GCD is a. This is because any number divides 0, so the largest common divisor is a.
Recursive case: If b is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments a % b and b. This is based on the property that the GCD of a and b is the same as the GCD of a % b and b.
Termination: The recursion eventually terminates because the remainder a % b gets smaller in each recursive call until it becomes 0.
Therefore, the code correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm and will calculate the GCD of any two non-negative integers.

Example usage:

Python
result = gcd(12, 18)
print(result)  # Output: 6
Use code with caution.

This code will correctly output 6, which is the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18.
