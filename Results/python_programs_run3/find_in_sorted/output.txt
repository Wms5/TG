Identifying the Bug

The primary issue with the provided code lies in the recursive calls within the binsearch function. The recursive calls are not correctly adjusting the search space. This can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results, especially when the target element is not present in the array.

Fixing the Bug

Here's the corrected binsearch function:

Python

def binsearch(start, end):
    if start > end:
        return -1  # Element not found
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if x == arr[mid]:
        return mid
    elif x < arr[mid]:
        return binsearch(start, mid - 1)
    else:
        return binsearch(mid + 1, end)
Explanation of the Fix

Base Case: If start becomes greater than end, it means the element is not present in the array, so we return -1.
Midpoint Calculation: The mid is calculated as before.
Comparison and Recursive Calls:
If x is equal to arr[mid], we've found the element and return mid.
If x is less than arr[mid], we search the left half by adjusting the end to mid - 1.
If x is greater than arr[mid], we search the right half by adjusting the start to mid + 1.
Complete Corrected Code

Python

def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return -1
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x == arr[mid]:
            return mid
        elif x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binsearch(mid + 1, end)

    return binsearch(0, len(arr) - 1)
By making these adjustments, the binary search algorithm will correctly find the target element's index or return -1 if it's not present.
