Identifying the Bug

The primary issue with the provided flatten function lies in the recursive call within the else block. When x is not a list, recursively calling flatten(x) on a non-list element will lead to a TypeError.

Correcting the Function

Here's a corrected version of the flatten function that addresses the issue:

Python
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            yield from flatten(x)
        else:
            yield x
Use o código com cuidado.

Explanation of the Correction:

Yield from:
This Python syntax is used to delegate the iteration of an iterable object directly to the caller.
In this case, when x is a list, we recursively call flatten(x) and use yield from to directly yield each element from the nested list.
Direct Yield:
If x is not a list, we simply yield x itself, avoiding the unnecessary recursive call.
Example Usage:

Python
arr = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]]
flattened_arr = list(flatten(arr))
print(flattened_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Use o código com cuidado.

This corrected flatten function effectively flattens nested lists, handling both list and non-list elements without errors.
