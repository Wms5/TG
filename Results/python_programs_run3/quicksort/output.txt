Identifying the Bug:

While the provided quicksort implementation is a common recursive approach, it has a subtle inefficiency. The issue lies in the repeated slicing of the arr[1:] portion in both the lesser and greater recursive calls. This redundant slicing can lead to performance degradation, especially for larger arrays.

Fixing the Bug: Using Two-Pointer Technique:

To optimize the partitioning step, we can employ a two-pointer technique:

Python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    pivot = arr[0]
    left = 1
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        while left <= right and arr[left] <= pivot:
            left += 1
        while left <= right and arr[right] > pivot:
            right -= 1
        if left <= right:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right
 -= 1

    arr[0], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[0]

    return quicksort(arr[:right]) + [pivot] + quicksort(arr[right+1:])

Explanation of the Optimized Approach:

Base Case: If the array has one or fewer elements, it's already sorted.
Pivot Selection: Choose the first element as the pivot.
Two-Pointer Partitioning:
Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the second and last elements, respectively.
Move left to the right until an element greater than the pivot is found.
Move right to the left until an element less than or equal to the pivot is found.
If left is still less than or equal to right, swap the elements at left and right.
Continue this process until left and right cross each other.
Pivot Placement: Swap the pivot with the element at right.
Recursive Calls: Recursively sort the subarrays to the left and right of the pivot.
Key Improvement:

By using the two-pointer technique, we avoid redundant slicing and directly partition the array in-place. This optimization significantly reduces the time complexity, especially for large datasets.
