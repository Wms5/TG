The provided Python code implements the Tower of Hanoi problem. It correctly calculates the sequence of moves required to transfer a stack of height discs from start peg to end peg using a helper peg.

Therefore, there is no bug in the code.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

Base case: If height is 0 (no discs), the function returns an empty list of steps.
Recursive case:
Finds the helper peg that is not start or end.
Recursively moves height - 1 discs from start to helper.
Moves the largest disc from start to end.
Recursively moves height - 1 discs from helper to end.
The code effectively solves the Tower of Hanoi problem.
