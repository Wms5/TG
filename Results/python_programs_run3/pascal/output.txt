Analyzing the Pascal's Triangle Implementation

The Bug:

The primary issue lies in the way the upleft and upright elements are accessed. The c - 1 index in upleft can lead to an out-of-bounds error when c is 0.

Fixing the Bug:

Here's a corrected version of the pascal function:

Python
def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = [1]  # First element is always 1
        for c in range(1, r):
            upleft, upright = rows[r - 1][c - 1], rows[r - 1][c]
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        row.append(1)  # Last element is always 1
        rows.append(row)

    return rows
Use o cÃ³digo com cuidado.

Explanation of the Fix:

Simplified Initialization: The first and last elements of each row are always 1, so we can directly initialize them without conditional checks.
Direct Assignment: We assign the upleft and upright elements directly to variables for cleaner code and potential performance improvements.
Removed Unnecessary Conditionals: The if c > 0 and if c < r conditions are redundant, as the loop boundaries already ensure that c is within the valid range.
Example Usage:

Python
print(pascal(5))
Use o cÃ³digo com cuidado.

This will output:

[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
By addressing the out-of-bounds issue and simplifying the code, the corrected pascal function provides a more efficient and reliable implementation of Pascal's Triangle.
