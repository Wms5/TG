Identifying the Bug

The provided code snippet implements the Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm to detect a cycle in a linked list. While it's a correct algorithm, the implementation has a potential issue:

The issue:
The while True loop continues indefinitely, even if the hare pointer reaches the end of the list without encountering a cycle. This can lead to an infinite loop.

Fixing the Bug

To address this, we can modify the loop condition to check if the hare pointer has reached the end of the list:

Python
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while hare and hare.successor:
        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True

    return False

Explanation of the Fix:

Loop Condition:

The while hare and hare.successor condition ensures that the loop continues only if both hare and its successor are not None.
This prevents the hare pointer from going beyond the end of the list, avoiding the infinite loop.
Cycle Detection:

If the hare and tortoise pointers meet at the same node, a cycle is detected, and True is returned.
If the loop completes without finding a cycle, False is returned.
By incorporating this change, the code becomes more robust and efficient, accurately detecting cycles in linked lists while avoiding potential infinite loops.
