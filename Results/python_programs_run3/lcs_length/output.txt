Identifying the Bug

The provided Python code aims to calculate the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two strings s and t using dynamic programming. However, there's a crucial bug in the implementation:

The Issue:

The problem lies in the line:

Python
dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1
Use o código com cuidado.

This line incorrectly assumes that the LCS at position (i, j) is always one more than the LCS at position (i-1, j). This is not always the case. The correct approach is to consider the LCS at positions (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), and (i, j-1) and choose the maximum.

Fixing the Bug

Here's the corrected code:

Python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(t)

    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

    return dp[m][n]

Use o código com cuidado.

Explanation of the Correction:

Initialization: We initialize a 2D DP table dp of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of s and t, respectively. The first row and column are initialized to 0.
Filling the DP Table:
If s[i-1] and t[j-1] are equal, the LCS at (i, j) is one more than the LCS at (i-1, j-1).
Otherwise, the LCS at (i, j) is the maximum of the LCS at (i-1, j) and (i, j-1).
Returning the Result: The final answer is stored in dp[m][n].
This corrected implementation accurately calculates the LCS length and addresses the bug in the original code.
