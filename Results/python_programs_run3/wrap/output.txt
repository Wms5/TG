Identifying the Bug

The provided wrap function is designed to break a given text into lines, ensuring that no line exceeds the specified cols limit. However, it has a potential issue:

The Issue:

The function might not handle the last line correctly. If the last line's length is less than or equal to cols, it won't be added to the lines list.

Fixing the Bug

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the last line issue:

Python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]
        lines.append(line.strip())  # Strip leading/trailing whitespace

    # Add the last line, even if it's shorter than `cols`
    lines.append(text.strip())

    return lines

Explanation of the Fix:

Handling the Last Line:

The original function only added lines while the text length was greater than cols.
The corrected version adds the remaining text to the lines list after the loop, ensuring that the last line is included.
Stripping Whitespace:

The strip() method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line, including the last one, to prevent unnecessary spaces.
Example Usage:

Python
text = "This is a long text that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines."
cols = 20

wrapped_lines = wrap(text, cols)
for line in wrapped_lines:
    print(line)
Use o código com cuidado.

With this corrected version, the last line will be properly included in the output, even if it's shorter than the specified cols limit.
