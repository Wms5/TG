Understanding the Code

The provided Python code implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by iteratively relaxing edges, considering all possible intermediate nodes.

Identifying the Bug

The bug lies in the line:

Python
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]
)
Use o c贸digo com cuidado.

This line is intended to update the shortest path from node i to node j by considering node k as an intermediate node. However, the correct formula for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm should be:

Python
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
)
Use o c贸digo com cuidado.

The mistake is using length_by_path[j, k] instead of length_by_path[k, j]. This incorrect calculation can lead to incorrect shortest path lengths.

Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, simply replace the incorrect line with the correct one:

Python
length_by_path[i, j] = min(
    length_by_path[i, j],
    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
)
Use o c贸digo com cuidado.

Corrected Code

Python
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )

    return length_by_path
Use o c贸digo com cuidado.

With this correction, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will now correctly compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
