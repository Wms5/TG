Identifying the Bug

The primary issue with the provided get_factors function lies in its recursive approach and the way it handles prime numbers.

Problem:

Incomplete Factorization for Prime Numbers: When the input n is a prime number, the loop doesn't find any divisors within the specified range. This leads to an empty list being returned, even though the number itself is a factor.
Fixing the Bug

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the prime number issue:

Python

def get_factors(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i

    # If n is still greater than 1, it's a prime factor
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors
Explanation of the Fix:

Iterative Approach: The function now uses an iterative approach, which is often more efficient for this kind of problem.
Prime Factor Handling:
The loop continues dividing n by i as long as i is a divisor. This ensures that all prime factors are captured, including those that appear multiple times.
If n remains greater than 1 after the loop, it's a prime factor itself and is added to the factors list.
Example Usage:

Python

print(get_factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(get_factors(17))  # Output: [17]
print(get_factors(1))   # Output: []
This revised function provides a more accurate and efficient solution for finding the factors of a given number.
