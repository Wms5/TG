Identifying the Bug:

The primary issue with the provided flatten function lies in the recursive call within the else block. When encountering a non-list element, the function recursively calls itself with that element as input. This leads to an infinite recursion, as the function never reaches a base case where it can terminate.

Fixing the Bug:

To correct this, we should only recurse on list elements. For non-list elements, we can directly yield them:

Python
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            yield from flatten(x)
        else:
            yield x
Use o código com cuidado.

Explanation of the Fix:

Recursive Case:

If x is a list, we recursively call flatten on x and use yield from to yield each element from the recursive call. This effectively flattens nested lists.
Base Case:

If x is not a list, we directly yield x. This handles the case of non-list elements, preventing infinite recursion.
Example Usage:

Python
arr = [1, 2, [3, 4], 5, [6, [7, 8]]]
result = list(flatten(arr))
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Use o código com cuidado.

By making this modification, the flatten function will correctly flatten nested lists without falling into infinite recursion.
