Analyzing the Shunting Yard Algorithm Implementation

The provided Shunting Yard algorithm implementation has a potential bug related to operator precedence and handling of unary minus.

The Bug:

The primary issue lies in the comparison of operator precedence within the while loop. The condition precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]] might lead to incorrect token order in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with unary minus.

Fixing the Bug:

To address this, we need to introduce a mechanism to distinguish between binary and unary minus operators. One common approach is to include a special token, such as UMINUS, to represent unary minus. Here's the modified implementation:

Python
def shunting_yard(tokens):
    precedence = {
        '+': 1,
        '-': 1,
        '*': 2,
        '/': 2,
        'UMINUS': 3  # Higher precedence for unary minus
    }

    rpntokens = []
    opstack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, int):
            rpntokens.append(token)
        elif token == '-':
            # Check if it's a unary minus
            if not opstack or opstack[-1] in ('(', '+', '-', '*', '/'):
                opstack.append('UMINUS')
            else:
                while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:
                    rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())
                opstack.append(token)
        else:
            while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:
                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())
            opstack.append(token)

    while opstack:
        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())

    return rpntokens

Explanation of the Fix:

Unary Minus Token: We've introduced a new token UMINUS with higher precedence than binary minus.
Unary Minus Detection: We check if the current token is - and if the previous token is an operator or the beginning of the expression. If so, we push UMINUS onto the operator stack.
Operator Precedence: The while loop ensures that operators with higher or equal precedence are popped from the stack and added to the output queue before pushing the current operator.
Additional Considerations:

Tokenization: Ensure that your tokenization process correctly identifies unary minus and other operators.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to catch invalid input expressions, such as mismatched parentheses or invalid operators.
Postfix Evaluation: The output of the Shunting Yard algorithm is a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression. You'll need to implement a separate function to evaluate this RPN expression.
By incorporating these modifications, you can improve the accuracy and robustness of your Shunting Yard algorithm implementation.
