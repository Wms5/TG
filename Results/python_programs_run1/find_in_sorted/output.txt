Identifying the Bug:

The primary issue with the provided code lies in the recursive calls within the binsearch function. The recursive calls might lead to infinite recursion in certain cases, particularly when x is not present in the array.

Fixing the Bug:

To correct this, we need to ensure that the search space is always reduced in each recursive call. Here's the corrected version:

Python

def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return -1  # Not found
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x == arr[mid]:
            return mid
        elif x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binsearch(mid + 1, end)

    return binsearch(0, len(arr) - 1)
Explanation of the Fix:

Base Case: The base case is now start > end, indicating that the search space has been exhausted without finding the target element.
Recursive Calls:
If x is less than the middle element, the search space is narrowed down to the left half (start to mid - 1).
If x is greater than the middle element, the search space is narrowed down to the right half (mid + 1 to end).
By adjusting the recursive calls in this way, we guarantee that the search space is always reduced, preventing infinite recursion.
