Analyzing the Merge Sort Implementation

The provided Merge Sort implementation is generally correct and efficient. However, there's a potential issue in the merge function that could lead to incorrect results in specific edge cases:

The Issue:

The problem lies in the line:

Python
result.extend(left[i:] or right[j:])
Use o código com cuidado.

This line is intended to append the remaining elements from either left or right to the result list. However, in Python, the or operator returns the first truthy value. If either left[i:] or right[j:] is an empty list, it's considered falsy, and the other list will be appended, even if it's not empty.

The Fix:

To ensure that all remaining elements from both left and right are appended, regardless of their emptiness, we can modify the line as follows:

Python
result.extend(left[i:])
result.extend(right[j:])
Use o código com cuidado.

Corrected Merge Sort Implementation:

Python
def mergesort(arr):
    def merge(left, right):
        result = []
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] <= right[j]:
                result.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                result.append(right[j])
                j += 1
        result.extend(left[i:])

        result.extend(right[j:])
        return result


    if len(arr) == 0:
        return arr
    else:
        middle = len(arr) // 2
        left = mergesort(arr[:middle])
        right = mergesort(arr[middle:])
        return merge(left, right)
Use o código com cuidado.

With this modification, the merge function will correctly append all remaining elements to the result list, even if one of the lists is empty. This will ensure that the Merge Sort algorithm works as expected in all cases.
