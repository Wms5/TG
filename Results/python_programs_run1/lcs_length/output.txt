Identifying the Bug

The primary issue with the provided code lies in the calculation of the dp values. While the idea of using a counter to store the LCS lengths is correct, the recurrence relation used to update the dp values is incorrect.

Correcting the Recurrence Relation

The correct recurrence relation for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is:

dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if s[i] == t[j]
          max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) otherwise
This relation considers two cases:

Match: If the current characters in both strings match, increment the LCS length by 1, taking the previous diagonal value.
Mismatch: If the characters don't match, take the maximum LCS length from either the top or left cell in the DP table.
Corrected Code:

Python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    return dp[m][n]

Explanation of the Correction:

2D DP Table: We use a 2D DP table to store the LCS lengths for substrings ending at each pair of indices.
Base Cases: The first row and column of the DP table are initialized to 0, as there's no common subsequence if one of the strings is empty.
Iterative Filling: We iterate through the DP table, filling each cell based on the recurrence relation.
Return the Final Value: The final LCS length is stored in the bottom-right corner of the DP table.
This corrected code accurately calculates the LCS length and addresses the bug in the original implementation.
