Identifying the Bug:

While the provided quicksort implementation is generally correct, it has a subtle inefficiency: it creates new lists for lesser and greater in each recursive call. This can lead to significant overhead, especially for large input arrays.

Fixing the Bug: Using In-Place Partitioning:

To improve efficiency, we can modify the quicksort function to use in-place partitioning. This involves rearranging the elements of the input array directly, without creating new lists.

Here's the improved implementation:

Python
def quicksort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        quicksort(arr, low, pi - 1)
        quicksort(arr, pi + 1, high)

def partition(arr, low, high):

    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1

    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1

Explanation of the Improved Implementation:

quicksort function:

Takes the array, low index, and high index as input.
Calls the partition function to find the pivot index.
Recursively sorts the subarrays before and after the pivot.
partition function:

Selects the last element as the pivot.
Places smaller elements to the left of the pivot and larger elements to the right.
Returns the index of the pivot.
Key Improvement:

In-place partitioning: By rearranging elements within the original array, we avoid creating new lists in each recursive call, significantly reducing memory usage and improving performance, especially for large datasets.
This optimized quicksort implementation provides a more efficient and space-efficient solution for sorting arrays.
