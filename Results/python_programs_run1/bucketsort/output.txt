The provided bucketsort implementation does have a bug. The issue lies in the second loop where the sorted_arr is extended. Instead of iterating over counts, it should iterate over range(k). This ensures that all possible bucket indices are considered, even if their count is zero.

Here's the corrected implementation:

Python
def bucketsort(arr, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1

    sorted_arr = []
    for i in range(k):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * counts[i])

    return sorted_arr

Use code with caution.

This modification ensures that all elements are correctly placed in their respective buckets and the final sorted array is accurate.
