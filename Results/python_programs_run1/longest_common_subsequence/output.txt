Identifying the Bug

The provided Python code implements a recursive approach to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings a and b. However, there's a subtle inefficiency in the else branch.

The problem lies in the recursive calls. In the else branch, both longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]) and longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b) are computed, even though one of them is guaranteed to be a shorter subsequence. This leads to redundant calculations, especially for longer strings.

Fixing the Bug: Dynamic Programming Approach

To optimize the solution, we can employ a dynamic programming approach. This involves creating a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] stores the length of the LCS for the substrings a[0:i] and b[0:j].

Here's the corrected code using dynamic programming:

Python

def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    m, n = len(a), len(b)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Construct the LCS from the dp table
    lcs = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(a[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    return ''.join(reversed(lcs))
Explanation of the Dynamic Programming Approach:

Create a 2D Table: We initialize a 2D table dp of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of a and b, respectively.
Fill the Table: We iterate over the table and fill each cell dp[i][j] based on the following conditions:
If a[i-1] and b[j-1] are equal, the LCS length is one more than the LCS length of the previous substrings.
Otherwise, the LCS length is the maximum of the LCS lengths of the substrings obtained by removing the last character from a or b.
Construct the LCS: We trace back through the table, starting from the bottom-right corner, to reconstruct the LCS.
By using dynamic programming, we avoid redundant calculations and achieve a more efficient solution.
