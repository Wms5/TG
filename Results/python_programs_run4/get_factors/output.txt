Identifying the Bug

The primary issue with the provided get_factors function lies in its recursive approach and the way it handles prime numbers. It can lead to incorrect factorizations, particularly for prime numbers and numbers with repeated factors.

Fixing the Bug: A More Efficient Iterative Approach

Here's a corrected and more efficient iterative approach to find factors of a number:

Python

def get_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1

    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors
Explanation of the Correction:

Iterative Approach: The iterative approach avoids unnecessary recursion, making it more efficient, especially for large numbers.
Prime Factorization: The loop iterates up to the square root of n. If i divides n, it's added to the factors list, and n is divided by i repeatedly until i no longer divides it. This ensures correct handling of repeated factors.
Prime Number Handling: If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the remaining n is a prime factor.
Example Usage:

Python

print(get_factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(get_factors(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(get_factors(17))  # Output: [17]
This corrected function provides accurate factorizations for all positive integers, including prime numbers and numbers with repeated factors.
