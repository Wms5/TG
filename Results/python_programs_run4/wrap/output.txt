Identifying the Bug

The provided wrap function is designed to break a given text into lines, ensuring that no line exceeds the specified cols limit. However, it has a potential issue:

The Issue:

The function may produce lines that are slightly longer than the specified cols limit in certain edge cases. This occurs when the last word in a line is longer than the remaining space in the line.

Fixing the Bug

Here's a revised version of the wrap function that addresses this issue by ensuring that no line exceeds the cols limit:

Python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while text:
        # Find the last space within the `cols` limit
        end = text[:cols].rfind(' ')

        # If no space is found, break the word at the `cols` limit
        if end == -1:
            end = cols

        # Extract the line and update the remaining text
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()
        lines.append(line)

    return lines

Explanation of the Fix:

Iterate until the text is empty: The while text: loop ensures that all text is processed.
Find the last space within the limit: text[:cols].rfind(' ') searches for the last space within the first cols characters.
Handle word-breaking: If no space is found, end is set to cols, ensuring the word is broken at the limit.
Extract the line and update the remaining text: The line is extracted, and the remaining text is updated, removing any leading whitespace.
This revised version guarantees that no line exceeds the specified cols limit, providing a more accurate and robust text wrapping solution.
