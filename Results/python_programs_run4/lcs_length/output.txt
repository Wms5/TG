Identifying the Bug:

The primary issue with the provided code lies in the dynamic programming approach. The recurrence relation used to calculate the LCS length is incorrect. It only considers the case where the last characters of both strings match. However, the LCS can also be formed by omitting either the last character of s or the last character of t.

Correcting the Code:

Here's the corrected version of the lcs_length function, implementing the correct recurrence relation:

Python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    return dp[m][n]

Explanation of the Correction:

Initialization:

A 2D DP table dp is created to store the LCS lengths for substrings of s and t.
The first row and column of dp are initialized to 0, as the LCS of an empty string with any other string is 0.
Filling the DP Table:

Iterate over the characters of s and t.
If the current characters match, the LCS length at the current position is the LCS length of the previous substrings plus 1.
If the characters don't match, the LCS length is the maximum of the LCS lengths of the substrings obtained by omitting the last character of either s or t.
Returning the Result:

The final LCS length is stored in dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of s and t, respectively.
This corrected implementation correctly calculates the longest common subsequence length between the two input strings.
