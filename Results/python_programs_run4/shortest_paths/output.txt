Identifying the Bug

The provided code attempts to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. However, it contains a critical error in the relaxation step.

The issue lies in the line:

Python
weight_by_edge[u, v] = min(
    weight_by_node[u] + weight,
    weight_by_node[v]
)
Use o código com cuidado.

This line is incorrectly updating the weight of the edge itself, instead of the distance to the destination node. The correct approach is to update the distance to the destination node, which is stored in weight_by_node.

Correcting the Code

Here's the corrected version with the necessary fix:

Python
def shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):
    weight_by_node = {
        v: float('inf') for u, v in weight_by_edge
    }
    weight_by_node[source] = 0

    for i in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):
        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():
            weight_by_node[v] = min(
                weight_by_node[v],
                weight_by_node[u] + weight
            )

    return weight_by_node
Use o código com cuidado.

Explanation of the Fix

The corrected code now correctly updates the distance to the destination node v by comparing its current distance with the distance from the source node u to v through edge (u, v). This relaxation step is the core of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Additional Considerations

Negative Weight Cycles:

The Bellman-Ford algorithm can detect negative weight cycles. You can add a final loop to check for negative weight cycles after the main loop. If any distance is further reduced, a negative weight cycle exists.
Efficiency:

For sparse graphs, consider using adjacency list representation instead of a dictionary of edges.
Early termination is possible if no distance is updated in an iteration.
By addressing these points, you can improve the correctness and efficiency of the shortest path algorithm.
