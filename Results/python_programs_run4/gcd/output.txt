The provided gcd function appears to be correct and does not have any obvious bugs. It correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

Base case: If b is 0, then the GCD is a. This is because any number divides 0, and the largest common divisor of a and 0 is a.
Recursive case: If b is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments a % b and b. This is because the GCD of a and b is the same as the GCD of a % b and b.
Therefore, the gcd function is expected to work correctly for all non-negative integer inputs.
