The provided hanoi function correctly implements the Tower of Hanoi algorithm. It doesn't have any bugs.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Base case: If height is 0, the puzzle is already solved, so the function returns an empty list of steps.
Recursive case:
Finds the helper peg that is not start or end.
Recursively moves height - 1 disks from start to helper.
Moves the largest disk from start to end.
Recursively moves height - 1 disks from helper to end.
Appends all the steps to the list and returns it.
The function correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and returns a list of steps that can be followed to achieve the solution.
