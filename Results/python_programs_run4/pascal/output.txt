Identifying the Bug

The bug in the provided Pascal's triangle implementation lies in the out-of-bounds index access within the upleft calculation. When c is 0, c - 1 becomes negative, leading to an index error.

Fixing the Bug

To rectify this, we can modify the upleft calculation to ensure it's always within the bounds of the previous row:

Python
def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = []
        for c in range(r + 1):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c]
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        rows.append(row)

    return rows

Explanation of the Fix

The key change is in the for loop's range: for c in range(r + 1). This ensures that the loop iterates from 0 to r, inclusive. As a result, when c is 0, the upleft calculation correctly evaluates to 0, avoiding the out-of-bounds access.

With this modification, the code will produce the correct Pascal's triangle for any given n.
